| # | Category | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Enrollment & Demographics** | Race, gender, grade level, FRL |
| 2 | **Assessments / Test Scores** | State tests, proficiency levels, growth |
| 3 | **Graduation Rates** | 4-yr ACGR, extended rates, diploma types |
| 4 | **School/District Directory** | Names, IDs, addresses, coordinates, locale |
